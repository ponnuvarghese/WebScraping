# Web Scraping Project for Extracting Product Information from Carbon38

The objective of this project is to create a web scraping tool using the Scrapy framework to extract product information from the Carbon38 website. Carbon38 is an online platform that offers a variety of activewear and lifestyle products. The goal is to collect detailed information about different products, including images, brand, name, price, sizes, color, description, and product ID.

## Project Components:

 ### Scrapy Spider:
 The core of the project is a Scrapy spider named Carbon38Spider. This spider navigates through the product     listings pages on Carbon38, extracts relevant information, and follows links to individual product detail      pages for more detailed data.
